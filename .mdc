# Mandatory Development Convention (MDC) Rules

## Rule 1: Feature Workflow Compliance
**MANDATORY**: Always follow the `.cursor/feature-workflow-prompt.md` workflow explicitly and completely.

### Critical Requirements:
1. **Step 1**: Review Memory Bank - ALWAYS read `.cursor/.memorybank` first
2. **Step 2**: Analyze Request - Understand scope and impact
3. **Step 3**: Implement Changes & **MANDATORY USER CONFIRMATION**
   - Make requested code changes
   - **ðŸš¨ CRITICAL**: Present changes to user and request explicit confirmation
   - **ðŸ›‘ WORKFLOW PAUSE**: Wait for explicit "OK" or approval before proceeding
   - Do NOT proceed to documentation steps until user confirms changes work as expected
4. **Step 4**: Update Memory Bank (ONLY after user confirmation)
5. **Step 5**: Version Bump (ONLY after user confirmation)
6. **Step 6**: Update Changelog (ONLY after user confirmation)
7. **Step 7**: Create Feature Documentation (ONLY after user confirmation)
8. **Step 8**: Update README if necessary (ONLY after user confirmation)

### Violation Consequences:
- Failure to follow this workflow will have consequences as stated by the user
- User confirmation is NOT optional - it is MANDATORY
- Documentation steps are FORBIDDEN until user approval is received

### User Confirmation Format:
```
## ðŸ”„ User Confirmation Required

I have implemented the following changes:
[List all changes made]

**Please test the functionality and confirm:**
- Does everything work as expected?
- Are you satisfied with the implementation?
- Should I proceed with documentation updates?

**Waiting for your explicit approval before proceeding to documentation steps.**
```

## Rule 2: Translation Completeness
- Always search for and translate ANY non-English text found in the codebase
- Use grep search with appropriate character ranges for different languages
- Document all translations made

## Rule 3: Version Control
- Never update versions, changelogs, or memory bank until user confirms changes work
- Always follow semantic versioning rules defined in the workflow prompt

**REMEMBER: The workflow exists for a reason. Follow it completely, or face consequences.**
